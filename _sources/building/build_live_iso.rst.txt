Build an ISO Hybrid Live Image
==============================

.. sidebar:: Abstract

   This page explains how to build a live image. It contains:

   * how to build an ISO image
   * how to run it with QEMU

A Live ISO image is a system on a removable media, e.g CD/DVD or USB stick.
Once built and deployed it boots off from this media without interferring
with other system storage components. A useful pocket system for testing
and demo and debugging purposes.

The following example shows how to build a live ISO image based on
openSUSE Leap:

1. Make sure you have checked out the example image descriptions,
   see :ref:`example-descriptions`.

2. Build the image with KIWI:

   .. code:: bash

      $ sudo kiwi-ng --type iso system build \
           --description kiwi-descriptions/suse/x86_64/suse-leap-42.3-JeOS \
           --target-dir /tmp/myimage

   Find the image with the suffix :file:`.iso` below :file:`/tmp/myimage`.

3. Test the live image with QEMU:

   .. code:: bash

      $ qemu -cdrom LimeJeOS-Leap-42.3.x86_64-1.42.3.iso -m 4096

After the test was successful, the image is complete and ready to use.
See :ref:`iso_to_usb_stick` and :ref:`iso_as_file_to_usb_stick`
for further information.
